# Automated Requirement Engineering Toolkit

* The toolkit acts as a fully automated Requirement Engineering guide by generating and requirements, classifying them, detecting and resolving requirement conflicts.

To run the toolkit, download the code and saved models, install the requirements from the requirements.txt file available and run main.py "your_text_input.txt"
You need to use your own GPT-3 API from OpenAI that can be changed in gpt3.py 
Results folder will automatically store generated results.
Happy Requiremnt Eliciting!!!
